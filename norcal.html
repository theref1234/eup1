<h2> California Route 1: The Best of the Best </h2>
<p> When you cross into California at Smith River on Hwy. 101, there is a dramatic change in mood.  I lived in California back in the 70s and I truly loved the experience.  But, California is not the same place any more.  In particular, the southern part of the state is vastly over-crowded and, in essence, used up and consumed.  However, this is not the case in the northern end of the state where there are no scriptwriters or venture capitalists. As you progress down Hwy 101 past Crescent City and Eureka, you will get a view of old time California. Bear in mind that the Spanish, the Russians, and New England whalers have been here before you.
</p>
<p> A couple of hours into California, you will want to take the exit at Leggett which will put you on Route 1 at its northern extreme.  The next 20 miles or so will be some of the sharpest curves that you have ever seen but at the end you will emerge at the ocean at the second most remote part of the entire California coast.  (The most remote part traverses the King Range.  The engineers that built Route 1 decided that it was too rugged even for them.  There is no road for that stretch of the coast-only a few roads out that dead end at the beach.)
