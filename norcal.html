<h2> California Route 1: The Best of the Best </h2>
<p> When you cross into California at Smith River on Hwy. 101, there is a dramatic change in mood.  I lived in California back in the 70s and I truly loved the experience.  But, California is not the same place any more.  In particular, the southern part of the state is vastly over-crowded and, in essence, used up and consumed.  However, this is not the case in the northern end of the state where there are no scriptwriters or venture capitalists. As you progress down Hwy 101 past Crescent City and Eureka, you will get a view of old time California. Bear in mind that the Spanish, the Russians, and New England whalers have been here before you.
</p>
<p> A couple of hours into California, you will want to take the exit at Leggett which will put you on Route 1 at its northern extreme.  The next 20 miles or so will be some of the sharpest switchback curves that you have ever seen but at the end you will emerge at the ocean at the second most remote part of the entire California coast.  (The most remote part traverses the King Range which is north of where Route 1 leaves the coastline at it northern end.  The engineers that built Route 1 decided that it was too rugged even for them.  There is no road for that stretch of the coast-only a few roads out that dead end at the beach.)
</p>
<p>While in Mendocino, explore the coastal headlands and the town itself.  Except for the daily flood of tourists, those who remain in the town are mostly locals so you can get a pretty good sense of what it is like to live there.

</p>
<p> When it is time to leave, you have a choice of routes to take to get to your next stop.  You can take the faster option which is SR128 inland to Highway 101 at Cloverdale.  This would also allow you the option of stopping in the Napa Valley for wine and olive oil provisions.  Or, you could take the slower but gloriously scenic drive by continuing down Highway 1 and rejoin 101 at Mill Valley in Marin County.  You will miss Napa but, perhaps you can go there on your way back to Washington State.

		The best place to stay in Mendocino?
		</h2>
		<p>
			The best place that I know of is the Little River Inn just south of Mendocino itself.  Quiet and clean and reasonably priced, this motel also has decent food in its bar.
