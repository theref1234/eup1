	<h2> Keep Your Eyes on the Road </h2>
	<p>The way out of San Francisco is along Lombard Street towards the Golden Gate Bridge.  You cut off on Route 1 just before the bridge.  You will go out 19th Avenue past San Francisco State University onto a combination of I-280/1.  Once out to the coast, again you can decompress after having been overstimulated in the city.
	</p>
	<p>You will be passing through Half Moon Bay where the big wave surfers hit the water at Mavericks. After several small towns, the next major town is Santa Cruz.  Beyond that is Monterey, the site featured in many John Steinbeck novels. <em>(Cannery Row, Tortilla Flat, and East of Eden)</em>  After Monterey and Carmel, the real Highway 1 bares it teeth. The road twists and turns along cliffs several hundred feet above the ocean.  Make sure that you stop somewhere near the Bixby Bridge which is just north of Big Sur
	</p>
	<p>
		The place to stay in Big Sur is the Big Sur Lodge.  This is one place that you may want to book in advance since it can get mighty crowded in the summer.  Ironically, the typical summer weather is a somewhat foggy.  The best weather is September and early spring.  The more expensive places such as Clint Eastwood's Post Ranch Inn and Ventana are far better but cost four or five times as much.

<h2> This is the land of the gods! </h2>
<p>High above the ocean, the California Condor soars over the coast along the coastal mountains.
