<h2> Background</h2>

	<p>
This web site is NOT about my past vacations.  Nobody wants to hear about the wonders of someone else's vacation.  Rather, this is an attempt to open your eyes to the possibility of a roadtrip to Big Sur (or other destinations in the northern part of California).  My major contention is that this trip by car will be far more enjoyable than an airplane ride. 
	</p>

<p>
California is a great destination-perhaps the greatest for a one week or longer trip.  From the wild coastal areas to ultra-sophisticated San Francisco, there are not many areas that can compete for weather and scenic beauty.  But, why take such a long drive?  Aside from the increasing hassles with airport security, the fact is that when you drive somewhere you have a <em>greatly increased sense of being there </em> in that location where you are. You can also easily get to remote places that are difficult by plane. There is also the fact that you will have a car at your destination.</p>

<p>
This trip will take about a week with stops in Bandon OR, Mendocino CA, San Francisco Ca, and Big Sur.  There will be a lot of driving but you can pull off the road anywhere that you find to be of interest.  The first day you will be driving to Bandon via I-5 to Roseburg and OR 42 over to the coast. and it will take you most of the day.  If you have more time, the preferred route is over the bridge at Astoria OR and down the entirety of the Oregon coast on Hwy. 101. (The bridge over the Columbia River is as close to an amusement park ride as you will ever experience in your own car.) You can stop in Newport OR or, for a really long day via this route, all the way to Bandon.  On this longer route, you get to see the wide variety of topography along the the whole coast.
</p>
<p> In my experience, the best way to do this trip is to NOT PLAN AHEAD.  By that I mean not to book hotels in advance.  That cements you in to a schedule.  This trip is not about a schedule.  You  will want to stay an extra day to-not because you have to get to the next waypoint on your trip plan.  It might cost you a bit more the freedom to stay an extra day in a place that you like is worth it.

 <h3> What to drive on this trip? </h3>
 <p> The best car to take on this trip is the one that you own-if is safe and dependable. Bigger and more comfortable is better.  Four wheel drive should be considered if you are travelling in the months of Nov-Apr. (I hit 5 inches of snow on 101 in April!) A smart phone with Bluetooth will provide background music or podcasts when you are out of range of broadcast radio. This is even better than satellite radio because you can collect music or podcasts that are specifically interesting to you. </P>\
