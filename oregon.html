	<h2> The Oregon Coast </h2>
	<p>
	When you emerge on the coast at Astoria or Bandon, you will get widely different perspective.  In Astoria, you will see an old fashioned city with many remaining Victorian-style houses.  In Bandon, you will see a small town with a wild and empty beach.

<h2> Do not miss the Panini Bakery in the Nye Beach section of Newport Oregon</h2>
<p> Another Roadside Attraction?  No way.  This is the place to stop if you take the coastal Oregon route.  It has the best pizza, soups, sandwiches, and pastries.  If you intend to continue on to Bandon, stock up here for some food on the road.  If you stay in Newport over night, look into the Elizabeth Street Inn.
