	<h2> The Oregon Coast </h2>
	<p>
	When you emerge on the coast at Astoria or Bandon, you will get widely different perspective.  In Astoria, you will see an old fashioned city with many remaining Victorian-style houses.  In Bandon, you will see a small town with a wild and empty beach.

<h2> Do not miss the Panini Bakery in the Nye Beach section of Newport Oregon</h2>
<p> Another Roadside Attraction?  No way.  This is the place to stop if you take the coastal Oregon route.  It has the best pizza, soups, sandwiches, and pastries.  If you intend to continue on to Bandon, stock up here for some food on the road.  If you stay in Newport over night, look into the Elizabeth Street Inn.

<p>
All you have to remember are three numbers: 101.  Leaving Newport, you will cross the Yaquina Bay Bridge on this road and it will take you all the way to Bandon by way of a variety of small, coastal towns.One of these is Florence which is in the heart of the dunes area.

<p>
When you get to Bandon, there are two great places to stay.  If you  have the bucks, Bandon Dunes is a great place to stay. It is to the west of Hwy. 101 as you are nearing Bandon. If you don't have a big budget but it is December or January (when it is not good for the golfers that are main guest demographic, the prices come way down). For the very best ocean/beach views, go to the Windemere On the Beach which is on Beach Loop Road.  No matter where you stay, try to have dinner at Alloro Wine Bar for amazingly good Italian food and wine.
